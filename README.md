# Gemini CLI Extension - MCP Toolbox

Develop and query your custom tools using the power of natural language, directly
from your command line through [MCP
Toolbox](https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox). Go from an idea to a
running, invocable tool in minutes, without ever leaving your terminal.

  support for OpenTelemetry.
